# STAT3302_Final_Project (Due Friday, 4/17)

# Description

#Group members:
* (Drago)Zhengqi Dong: dong.760@osu.edu
* Jae Han
* Shuhan Shen
* Yunxiao Wang

# TO-DO:
1. Decide the dataset for project? 
    * Analysis must involves Logistic/Poisson regression model. 
    * Should have enough covariates to make an intersting statistical analysis(Q: What does enought means?)
2. The scientific questions to ask?
3. What covariates are useful for answering our question? (Plot the graph and give an graphical summary)
4. Model comparison (Which model has the best "Performance"?)
5. Does the models fit well? Explain why?


# DONE:

# Checking list: (Based on Project description)
1. Make sure that you write down a scientific question for your group to answer in your
project. Make sure you answer the question using the results of your statistical analysis.
2. Select a dataset with enough cases so you can adequately estimate the different effects in
your model. Your dataset should have enough covariates to make for an interesting statistical
analysis. Make sure to investigate for possible interaction effects.
3. Exploratory data analysis, as well as model building, model selection, and diagnostics must
be part of your statistical analysis.
4. You should take time to explain the interpretation of your statistical model and to answer
the original scientific question.
5. You may want to include some discussion of your results and ideas for further analysis at
the end of the report. If you have references, format them appropriately.
6. You may include R code in an appendix (not counted in the 5â€“6 page limit), but no R code
or R summaries can be included in the main report. For example, present your results in
tables and make sure to discuss your results in the text of the report.
7. For the report use a 12pt font with 1.5 spacing (like this document!)
8. Make sure that all students contribute equally in your group. Each student in a group will
be assigned the same grade.
